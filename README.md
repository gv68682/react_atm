# ATM Transactions

## Description:
Tried to simulate bank ATM transactions which consists of deposit or withdrawal and calculating the account balance after each transaction.

## Coding process:
With the help of REACT components which contains useState hook to mimic bank account and ATM to render their current state into UI. Created handleChange function to validate the transaction and to update the deposit state. Also created handleSubmit which calculates and updates totalAmount based on deposit or cash back to re-render current account balance.
Validated customer account balance with withdrawal amount to alert customer with proper error message. Disabled the submit button in case of invalid transaction.
Set the input box to accept positive numbers only. Applied css while enhancing the application.
